Installation
============

Installation is easy.
Install all dependencies, which are just Theano and h5py (:code:`pip install theano h5py`).
For TensorFlow, use :code:`pip install tensorflow-gpu` and make sure that CUDA and cuDNN can be found.
Then just checkout the Git repository of RETURNN (https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn/) and you are ready to go.

See :ref:`basic_usage` for the basic usage.
